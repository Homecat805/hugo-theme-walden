On this day in 1980, U.S. President Jimmy Carter signed the Alaska National Interest Land Protection Act. Previously, Alaska had no national parks, but now there are 8 national parks, as well as many memorials and reserves, protecting more than 157 million acres. It is because of this law that the public has the opportunity to enjoy the stunning natural scenery pictured today, the 51-mile Trikakilla River Delta in Clark Lake National Park.

In the local indigenous Athabasca language, the Trikaquila River means "there are salmon in the river". The park is famous for rivers full of salmon, which are also vital to the local economy and ecosystem. Salmon also make the local "bear ding" thrive, and bear watching is a popular project in Clark Lake Park. The wolves in the park also feed on salmon, the only known wolf pack in the world that feeds only on salmon.
