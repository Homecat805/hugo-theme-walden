After reading <i><b>Walden</b></i>, a collection of essays by American writer Henry David Thoreau, I was deeply influenced by his love of nature and simple living. So, I wrote this concise and clear theme for my personal website and named it Walden.

    cd exampleSite
    hugo server --themesDir ../..
    ```

## Quick start

The Hugo documentation [https://gohugo.io/installation/](https://gohugo.io/installation/) describes in detail how to install on different operating systems, which will not be repeated here, the operating system related to this article is Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

- Create the website root directory `mysite` and perform git initialization:

    ```
    mkdir mysite
    cd mysite
    git init
    git branch -m main
    ```

- Install the theme as a module to the `mysite/themes` directory of the website, and copy all the files in the `exampleSite` directory within the theme to the root directory of the website:

    ```
    mkdir themes
    git submodule add git@github.com:Homecat805/hugo-theme-walden.git themes/hugo-theme-walden
    cp -rf themes/hugo-theme-walden/exampleSite/* ./
    ```

In subsequent use, if you need to update the theme, use the following command:

```
git submodule update --remote --merge
```

## Configuration 

The configuration file for the site is `config.toml`。

- Configure baseURL: URL of user's website on the internet.

    ```
    baseURL = "https://github.com/homecat805/walden/"
    ```

- Configure theme

    ```
    theme = "hugo-theme-walden"
    ```

- Configure language mode: Multilingual mode is used by default, and single-language mode is configured as `false`.

    ```
    [params]
        multilingual = true  
    ```

- Configuration language: English is used by default, and `"zh"` for using Chinese.

    ```
    defaultContentLanguage = "en"
    ```

- Configure site name: According to Hugo documentation, websites in different languages are side by side, use different name for dependent site.

    ```
    [language]
        [languages.en]
            title = "Walden"
            ...
        [languages.zh]
            title = "瓦尔登湖"
            ...
    ```

- Configure author information

    ```
    [language]
        [languages.en]
            [languages.en.author]
                name = "Homecata"
                description = "Author Description"
                email = "13050082@qq.com"
                avatar = "images/avatar/default.jpg"
        [languages.zh]
            [languages.zh.author]

                email = "13050082@qq.com"
                avatar = "images/avatar/default.jpg"
