After reading <i><b>Walden</b></i>, a collection of essays by American writer Henry David Thoreau, I was deeply influenced by his love of nature and simple living. So, I wrote this concise and clear theme for my personal website and named it Walden.

Hugo is the worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites and one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again. 

In directory structure of Hugo, the content and theme are separated. The Hugo community provides many themes written by its members for free use. Of course, you can also write a unique theme for yourself.   

Walden is a responsive theme with good adaptability on both mobile phones and desktops, the design of distinctive shortcodes enhances the presentation of content. Walden is still multilingual, the website of each language is independent.

Although Walden is a theme I wrote for my personal website, I also hope you can enjoy and use it, and sharing should become a virtue for everyone.
